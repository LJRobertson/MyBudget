# MyBudget

INTRODUCTION
MyBudget is an expense tracker. Transactions may be imported from a .txt file (see formatting information below) or entered manually. The total is then displayed at the bottom of the application. 

HOW TO
To begin, launch the program from your preferred IDE. 

IMPORT .TXT
Click the Open File button to select a .txt file to load with transaction information. A demo file of TestTransactions.txt is included.

.TXT Format
The file should contain one transaction per row. The format is the transaction description, comma, the transaction amount. For example:

Groceries,89.77
Gasoline,53.86

The program will display the description in the left column and the amount in the right.

ADD TRANSACTION
Click the Add Transaction button to manually add a transaction to the display.
Both a Transaction Description and Transaction Amount are required. The amount must also be numeric.

Click the Submit button to add your transaction to the display and return the previous screen or select Cancel to return without adding a transaction.

QUIT
You may exit the program by clicking on the Quit button in the upper right corner.
